Encoding Culture was a class that focused on applying computer science principles to humanistic research goals. We learned about text, audio, and image analysis, how physical media is digitally encoded, and several machine learning Python tools. For our final project, another student and I worked on an AI querying system for art museums that could recommend art pieces to users based on text descriptions.

<!-- Understanding bit representation of variables in C
Using GPIO pins to activate LEDs on a board

You set those switches to represent some binary number, then pushed the button

<app-info-card title="Programming in C and Assembly - ASCII Lab" imgLink="assets/ScrollingText.mp4" text="
For this project, we set up a circuit to connect a microcontroller to several switches, buttons, and
an LED board. I programmed the microcontroller to read the inputs from the switches and buttons, where the positions of the switches corresponded to a binary number and the button indicated that we wanted to send that number to the controller. We then displayed the ascii character described by that number on the LED board.
We also implemented code to make the text on the LED board scroll, as can be seen in the video.

<app-info-card title="Fundamentals of Programming - Snekoban Game Solver" imgLink="assets/Grid.jpg" text="
Snekoban was our version of a game where you play as a character that is trying to move boxes around a grid
into certain positions. To make a solver, we represented each state as a node in a graph and used a
breadth-first-search (BFS) to solve the game in the minimum number of moves. Our program had to be optimized
to save the game's state and run the BFS algorithm in a limited amount of time.

Making a 2D implementation of Mines more stylistic and efficient
Implementing an Nth dimensional version using recursion
Had to realize we needed helper functions for making an Nd board, change an Nd board, find every combination of coordinates to find all neighbors(copied ingredient_mixes), combing the mixes with find_neighbors(not mutual recursion since coord mixes doesnâ€™t call find_neighbors) to find all neighbors, adding a key to the dictionary to track the number of hidden squares, method for accessing a coordinate
