        Our headboard, the green PCB, serves as our BMS and has two main roles:
        Monitoring the state of the car's electronics and controlling relays to supply power.
        It tracks the current being drawn by and supplied to the motors, solar panels, and charger.
        I validated its current measurements by comparing the output of our I2C library
        and the current we were drawing/delivering using a DC load. Having accurate current values
         allows us to emergency shut off the car in case currents get dangerously high.<br>
        The headboard is also responsible for controlling the precharge and high power relays that connect to
        the motors, solar panels, and charger, which I also tested using its I/O pins and contactors.

        We have 8 cellboards on our battery, each of which is responsible for 
        measuring the voltage and temperature of a sector of the battery. They also
        balance our battery so all the cells are at roughly equal voltages.
        I set up and debugged the IsoSpi connection between the headboard and 
        the cellboards, allowing them to communicate while the car was operational.
        The headboard uses the values from the cellboards to emergency shut off the 
        car if our battery becomes dangerously hot or has too much/too little voltage.

        For the motors, my role included configuring a wavesculptor motor controller
        to operate with a Mitsuba D3 motor, writing new code to control the motors using
        CAN messages from one of our PCBs, and installing the motors on the car. I also wrote
        code for receiving telemetry from the motors, which includes information about their velocities,
        temperatures, and error states.

        Our current car has several pieces of hardware that were not included
        on Nimbus, including an extra motor, a charger, and new MPPTs, all of which required adding new 
        messages to our CAN library. 
        This brought the total to 20 messages the dashboard needed to read, but the AT90CAN, our
         microcontroller, can only tranceive 15.
        To get around this, we rerouted the CAN, sending messages to other boards and merging
        them before sending them to the dashboard, which allowed us to have complete telemetry regarding
        every system on the car.<br>
        On the right side of the dashboard, there is a blue module labeled "Xbee", which I helped configure and test.
        This is the device we use to
        wirelessly transmit our telemetry from Gemini to our strategy team, which uses this information to
        make decisions about target speeds and charging times.<br>
        On the left, there is another blue device, our GPS module, which I wrote and tested code for to
        allow the strategy team to track our location during the race.

<!-- Below the dashboard is our display, with the motor speed being the most prominent value. This and other values
        on the display (such as the battery voltage and temperature) are populated using the telemetry that the dashboard
        gets from our CAN messages.An example of the velocity telemetry from the motors is shown below: -->
