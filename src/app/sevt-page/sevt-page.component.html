  <app-info-card class="whitespace-pre-line" title="Battery Management System (BMS)" imgLink="assets/Headboard.jpg" text="Our headboard, the green PCB, serves as our BMS and has two main roles:
  Monitoring the state of the car's electronics and controlling relays to supply power. It tracks the current being drawn by and supplied to the motors, solar panels, and charger. I validated its current measurements by comparing the output of our I2C library and the current we were drawing/delivering using a DC load. Having accurate current values allows us to emergency shut off the car in case currents get dangerously high. 
  The headboard is also responsible for controlling the precharge and high power relays that connect to
  the motors, solar panels, and charger, which I also tested using its I/O pins and contactors.">

  <app-info-card title="Cellboards" imgLink="assets/SingleCellboardOnBattery.jpg" text="We have 8 cellboards on our battery, each of which is responsible for 
  measuring the voltage and temperature of a sector of the battery. They also
  balance our battery so all the cells are at roughly equal voltages.
  I set up and debugged the IsoSpi connection between the headboard and 
  the cellboards, allowing them to communicate while the car was operational.
  The headboard uses the values from the cellboards to emergency shut off the 
  car if our battery becomes dangerously hot or has too much/too little voltage. ">

on the previous car, including an extra motor, a charger, and new MPPTs, all of which required adding new 
messages to our CAN library. 
This brought the total to 20 messages the dashboard needed to read, but our
 microcontroller can only tranceive 15.
To get around this, we rerouted the CAN, sending messages to other boards and merging
them before sending them to the dashboard, which allowed us to have complete telemetry regarding
every system on the car.

<app-info-card title = "Serial Drivers" imgLink="assets/SerialSetup.jpg" text = "Our serial drivers were originally
set up to send and receive one character at a time. I rewrote the logic involving the tx and rx buffers, as well
as the vector interrupts, to allows our boards to send and receive several characters at once while staying
synchronized with each other. Doing so made debugging our code with the serial monitor much easier. We used this extensively
while manufacturing our boards and during the race to debug unexpected issues.
